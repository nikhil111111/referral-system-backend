## Referral System Backend

This project is a backend system built using **Node.js**, designed to handle multi-level referral-based earnings. Users can refer others, and earnings get distributed based on referral levels â€” just like you'd see in a real-world referral or affiliate model.

---

## What This Project Does

- Allows new users to register with or without a referral.
- Automatically links them to a parent (referrer) if provided.
- Distributes earnings when users make purchases:
  1. 5% to their direct referrer (Level 1)
  2. to the referrer's parent (Level 2)
- Provides real-time notifications to parents when earnings are generated.
- Includes a reporting API to check how much a user has earned (both direct and indirect).

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js** + **Express.js** â€” for building APIs
- **MongoDB** + **Mongoose** â€” for storing users and earnings
- **Socket.IO** â€” for real-time notifications
- **Postman** â€” for testing APIs
